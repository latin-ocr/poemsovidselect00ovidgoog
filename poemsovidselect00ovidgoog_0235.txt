208 NOTES

8. Corycidas: Greek form of acc.; cf. Themin, v. 9. The
Corycium was a large cave on the side of Mt. Parnassus.—
numina montis: possibly the Muses, to whom later the
Castalian spring was sacred—adorant: the plural verb gives

, prominence to both Deucalion and Pyrrha ln the worship.

9. Themin: goddess of justice, daughter of Uranus and Gaea.
At this time she presided over the Delphic oracle.— oracla: by
syncope for oracula, as vinclum for vinculum, and periclum for
periculum.

10. non quisquam: = nullus or nec . . . nllus, and qualifies
vir as an adj. Quisquam is found chiefly in negative sentences.
A. 202. b. c; B. 252.4; G. 317. ¹3 H. 5133 M. 1071.—neo:
note that the Romans never use et non, sed non, etc, save when
aspecial word is to be negatived.-aequi: A. 218. b3 Β.
2041· ar G· 375· u· 1; H· 451·3; M· 574·

11. aut: the negative is continued3 hence nlla-metuen-
tior deorum: more god-fearing; for deornm, see the note on
aequi, v. 1o.—ulla: necessary here because qnisquam has no
feminine.

12. ut: temporal, when-orbem: acc. subject of the inf.
stagnare. For the construction here, see the note on sore, ll. 7.

13. virum: necessary here to render the gender of utinm
absolutely certain, while mulierem is not necessary with nnan1,·
thus aplace is left in v. 14 for videt. Repetitlon usually adds

emphasis or vividness but neither seems much heightened here,
and the repetition is somewhat cacophonous. —de . milibus :
’ of those who were so many thousandr just nonu—unum: ern- ·

phatic, only one. Note that this implied only is quite frequent
in both Greek and Latin. ,

16. nimbis remotis: the Romans having no perf. act. part,
used in such sentences either the abl. abs. or the more awkward
subordinate clause of time or the like. We may use in English,
beside the perf. act. part. and the subordinate clause, the pres.
act. partor a co'drdinate clause, but the last two are logically
inexact—aquilone: abl. of means. See the note on lI. 193
and cf. Gen. 8. 1, “And God made a wind to pass over the
earth, and the waters assuaged.''

17. Note the chiasmus of case-relations in caelo terras, aethera
