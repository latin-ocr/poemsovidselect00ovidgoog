THE FLOOD 201

15. ardeat: subj. in indir. disc, but the direct form would also
besubj. A. 3203 B. ²83³ G. 631. 23 H. 591· ις Μ. 836.-
mundi . . . operosa: thetm'l-wranglrt nrassasllnnnrld. Malas
emphasizes the dnlk and mergit or massmeness ol the world,
while operosa emphasizes the difficulty with which this mass
was wrought. Moles also includes the latter idea3 cf. Verg.
Aen.1.33,

Tantae malis erat Romanam eandm gentem.

-laboret: should latter. One school of ancient philosophy
believed that the world had arisen from lire, and would be de-
stroyed by fire. We have here probably a reference to the
Pha'e'thon episode. Cf. 2 Peter 3. 7: “But the heavens and the
earth which are now by the same word are kept in store, reserved
unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
men‚'’ Cf. also Lucretius 5. 96: —

Una dies dabit m'tz'o, multasque per annas
sustentata ruet ntales et trracm'na mnndi.

16. Tela: fulmina. -cyelopum the Cyclopes were repre-
sented in the Odyssey as a race of giants given to caunibalism.
They dwelt in caves on the mountain sides of an island which was
afterwards identified with Sicily. They knew nothing of the arts
of civilization, and feared neither gods nor men. Hesiod names
three, Brontes Steropes and Arges. The later poets represent
them as using the caverns'of Mount Etna for their smithy.

17. placet: sc. ei, and trans. ln resolves npan (lit. plcans
kam). Note the separation of noun and adj. by the verb.

rh. perdere . . . demittere: these phrases are in apposition
with paena, aud afford a very good example of ὕστερον πρότερον
Ὁμηρικῶς (‘ hysteron proteron after the manner of Homer ')‚ in
whichthe logical order of ideas is reversed. — demittere: note
the force of de. - caelo: cf. “And the windows of heaven were
opeued,'' Gen. 7. 11.

19. Aeoliis: af Aeolus. See the note onarbatcassetus,l. 16.
Aeolus was the ruler of the winds (Homer's ταμίης ἀνέμων). Cf.
Verg. Aen. 1. 52 ffi—Aquilonem: from the standpoint of a
Roman, since the north wind brings cold. fair weather in ltaly.
