PREFACE

Is any justification is needed ior sending forth
another edition of selections from the writings of
Ovid, it will be found, Ι trust, in the growing demand
for some easier poetry than Vergil's in the earlier
years of Latin reading. The Metamorphoses of
Ovid, bright and simple as they are, crowded with
myth and fable that ever attract and hold the atten-
tion oi the young, are peculiarly suitable for use in
the schools, and offer excellent preparation ior the
more arduous work to come. indeed, no simpler
poetry for this period can be found, and it is ear-
nestly to be hoped that Ovid will become more and
more popular and thus let Vergil assume his proper
place later in the course. Vergil is more difficolt,
and a much surer knowledge oi the Latin tongue is
needed to appreciate his stately and finished verse,
not to speak oi the maturer intelleet necessary to
grasp the meaning and content of so great an epic.

This edition, intended primarily for the use of
schools, consists of about three thousand verses care·
fully annotated and about one thousand verses for
rapid reading, with brief notes at the bottom of the
page. In the belief that the Metamorphoses are
best adapted for an introduction to Latin verse, the
selections therefrom, which form the greater part of
the book, are put first, and are more fully anno·
