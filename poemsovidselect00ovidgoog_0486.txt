MACMILLAN’S LATIN SERIES

conuentus NEPOS-Twenty Lives. Edited by J. E. Bauss
Latin Master in The Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Corm. Cloth,
xiv ψ 316 pp. Maps and Illustrations. Prlce 90 cente.

The Praefatio and the Lives of Miltiades, Themis-
tocles Aristides, Pausanias, Cimon, Lysander, Alcibi-
ades, Thrasybulus Conon, Dion, Iphicrates Chabrias,
and Epaminondas have been edited with full notes
and the Lives of Pelopidas, Agesilaus Phocion, Timo
leon, Hamilcar, Hannibal, and Cato, with foot-notes for
more rapid reading or for sight-reading. The vocabu-
lary covers both divisions of the text. There are Exer-
cises in Writing Latin based on the text, and simple
word-groups for the study of word-formation. Refer-
ences are given to the grammars ol Allen and Green-
ough, Bennett, Gildersleeve and Lodge, Harkness, Lane
and Morgan.

It has become customary in this country to substitute
other reading material for a portion of Caesar's Gallie
War, and for this purpose Nepos is particularly well
suited by the interest of his subject-matter, the small-
ness of his vocabulary, and the clearness and regularity
of his style. As a matter of fact, this author can easily
be read immediately after the completion of the elemen-
tary Latin lessons, and in Mr. Barss’s edition the needs
oi the pupil who is just learning to read Latin are con-
stantly considered. His edition contains all of the
Lives that any teacher will care to have a class read.
The Sheffield Scientific School accepts the first twelve
Lives as a substitute for two books of Caesar, and
the Regents of the State of New York allow the sub-
stitution of twenty Lives lor the entire requirement
of Caesar.
