foot of the hexameter is commonly a dactyl ; when a

¹ spondee is found in this ioot, the verse is called a

spondaic verse. The sixth ioot is always considered
a spondee. But the slight pause at the end oi the
verse makes it possible for a short syllable to stand
here. The final syllable is therefore called syllaba
anceps (doubtful syllable). The syllables of a metrical
foot may belong to one or more words. The constitu-
tion of the hexameter may, then, be represented thus :-

’ -ὧΙ-κῖυΙ-κῗυί-κῗυΙ-ὖυΙ-Ξ

Scansz'on is the division oi a verse into its metrical
feet; hence to scan a verse, we must know the quantity
oi the syllables composing each word. The rules of
quantity can be found in any Latin grammar. Some
technical terms of prosody will be treated here.

The long hexameter must have some place where
the reader may pause to catch his breath. There are
two. kinds of pauses, the Caesnra and the Diaeresls.
A Caesura occurs when a word ends willein a foot:

sponte.. aurensine . lege..fidem„rectumquencoilebat.

The caesura] pauses are here marked by double lines.
The ieet are separated by single lines: sponte su is a
foot‚ because the three syllables fill out the require·
ments oi the dactyl; again, dem rec is a foot, because
its two syllables fill out the requirements oi a spondee.
It will be seen that a caesura may fall after a long sylla-
ble (-ιι υ o or —y—l, or aiter the first short syllable of
the dactyl (- υ y o). When a caesura falls after the long
syllable, it is called Strong or Mascnline Caesura; when
