- antris: the caves were supposed by the ancients to beon one
of the Lipari lslands.

20. quaecumque flamina: all tlte blasts that. -lnduc-
tas: sc. terris, spread werthe earth. Note again the inter-
locked order of adj. and noun.

21. Notus: this is still from the Roman standpoint. The
south wind, coming to Rome from the Mediterranean‚ was laden
with moisture3 hence madidis alis—alls: as the winds were
personified into gods, they were represented with wings.

22. terribilem. . . vultum: note the very pretty position of
words in this verse. ··. tectus: ceveriitgy although a pass. part..⁸
it is construed with the acc. after the analogy of the Greek. A.
240.c.n.; B. 175. 2.d; G. 338. w.2; H.407; M.511.

23. barba: sc. ert—nimbis: abl. of cause with gravis. —
unda: here simply walen—captitiis: in prose we should
expect de capillis.

24. pennae: alae-sinus: since the god is represented as
cloud-clad, the sinus,felds of a garmeni, are quite properly men-
tioned here.

25. lats: far and wide-presslt: the ancients thought
thunder arose from the striking together of clouds. For the
mood and tense of pressit, see A. 324; B. 287; G. 561 ς Η. όο2;
Μ. 881.

26. Note the onomatopoeic effectos the verse, imitating in the
sound of fit fragor the sudden crash of thunder, while funduntur
ab aethere nimbi keeps pace with the fast-falling rain—hino:
temporal, hereupen.

27. Nuntia Iunonis: app. with Iris, subject os concepti.—
induta: agrees with Iris, and varios coleres is used like vultum,
v. 22.

28. concipit? draws up. Cf. Bibit ingens arcus, Verg. Georg.
1. 380.—Iris: she was at first messenger of the gods and later
became Juno's special messenger, as Mercury was Jove's. This
idea of messenger arose from the personification of the rainhnw,
which was also sometimes represented as the bridge over which
Iris passed from heaven to earth.
