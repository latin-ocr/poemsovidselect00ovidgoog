THE FOUR AGES 193

12. mollia securae otia gentes: observe the symmetry and
¹--l—-³ Ι
harmony of this line, which is a good example of the interlocked
order so common in prose and poetry.-soourae: used predi-
catively and to be translated by an adverbial phrase. A. 19¹3
B. 2393 G. 325.11.6; H. 497.—otia: cf. ora, v. 5.

13· Ipsa: with tellus, v. 14 Note how strongly the attention
is drawn to both ipsa and tellus by their long separation. Cf.
v. 1. —Ipea per se: usually per se ipsa in prose, and practically
equivalent to sponte sua in v. 2.-1mmun11: untannd,· immunis,
intacta, and saucia qualify tellus, which is here spoken of as a
human being, for these words properly describe persons. — nee:
and not,· it joins saucia with immunis and intacta, and negatives
saucia, to make it parallel with immunis and intacta, which are
negatived by the prefix in-. For the thought cf. 1v. 263, 264;

and Verg. Georg. 1. 127, 128:—
lpsaque tellus

omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.

1 ς. contenti: sc. homines, referring to the men of the golden
age-olbis: A. 254. b.2; B. 219. ¹3 G. 401. 1163 H. 476. 13
M. 629. -nnllo cogente: under no compulsion. Notice how
frequently this idea comes up: ipsa, numanis, intacta, nec saucia,
per se, nullo cogente, sinc semine, inarata. It is directly the
opposite of the thought in v. 49.

16. arbuteos letus: the fruit of the wild strawberry-tree is
meant. It was of a bright red color, and somewhat like our
strawberry‚ but smaller and insipid in taste. Note this use of the
adj. where we should use a substantive in the gen. case. lt
is a frequent usage in Ovid-montana fraga: the common
strawberry. Cf. Vergil's humi nascentia fragm—legebant:
“ used to guther or were wont to guther. Note this use of the
imperfect.

17. corna: the cornel-cherry, a berry with very little meat,
lilre our wrld cherry. Its mention helps to emphasize the easily
satisfied appetites of the men of the Golden Age—mora:
blackberries, but in VllI. 71 it means mulberries.

18. quae . . . glandis: in translating begin with glandis.
This incorporation of the antecedent in the relative clause is very

frequent in Latin, aud the arrangement throws special emphasis
