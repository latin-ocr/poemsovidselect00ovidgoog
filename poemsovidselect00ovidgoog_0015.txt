viii PREFACE

tated than the selections from the other writings. ·
The notes are concise and, it is hoped, as few as
possible for elucidating knotty points. Help is given
not merely in explanation ol grammatical matters,
but also in the interpretation oi the mythS, while
special attention is called to the meaning ol the Latin
word-order, and frequent aid is given lor making a
correct and fluent English rendering. As aids to
the study of verse, a brief summary of the general
laws of quantity and scansion is given in the intro-
duction, together with copious exercises, and the
quantity ol all long vowels is indicated in the earlier
selections Ι

= Special attention is called to the selections for rapid
or sight reading and the carefully prepared word-
groups. It is earnestly hoped that here at least the
pupil will work out the meaning in the Latin word-
order belore resorting to translation. Translation is
difficult, reading comparatively easy, and the artos
reading Latin in the word-order of the Romans once
acquired will be a never-failing pleasure throughout
life. To this end, constant use should be made ol
the word-groups. The root and meaning at the head
of each group should be lirmly fixed inlthe memory
when first consulted, and later reference thereto
should be rather lor the association of words. A
little slowness here and an earnest effort to master
the groups will smooth the way for a more rapid and
pleasant advance in the future. lt is surprising how
quickly one’s vocabulary increases and how much
more rapid and accurate is one’s progress when the
root-words of a language are at one's command.
