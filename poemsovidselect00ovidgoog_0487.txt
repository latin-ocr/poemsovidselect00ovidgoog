MACMILLAN'S LATIN SERIES .

COMMENT S

carletott L. Browttson, thlqge ostie t'ity osh'ew York.

“l arn sure it will ronse high anticipations ior the useiulness of your Latin
series. lt is truly not ‘over-edited,' —a most excellent feature in a school text-
book,—and it contains many things which will assist the teacher in making a
student think tor himsell; and this, atter all, is the great object of all our
reaching.''

J. P. Cushing, Heod Moster, Hillhouse Hagrh Sihool, Nero Hoven, Coun.

¹¹ Ἰ he series is well planned The Nepos oi Mr. Barss sets a high scholarly
mark.''

Jared W. semida, Latin Moster, Albony Acodem, Albony, N. Y.
“l think it is one ol the handsomest schoolbooks 1 have ever seen. The
impression it has made upon me thus iar is exceedingly lavorable.''

Lyman R. Allan, State Normol School, North Adonis, Mass.

“l am much pleased with the book. Its appearance is up to your usual
standard, and its illustrations are iar superior to any l can recall in any Latin
text-book. Ι like also the author's work. While Ι believe that the gaining oi
a right altitude toward translation and Latin composition (the substitution oi
one known idiom tor another) must depend mostly upon the teacher and only
slightly upon the book, yet 1 think Mr. Barss has done much to help the teacher
see and eniorce this; his notes show frequently not the solution but how to
reach it.''

Frederic S. Shepherd, Superintendent osSclrools, Astmy Pork, N. J

“The Nepos is a very attractive book, especially tor sight-reading. The type
is beautiful, the illustrations are excellent, and the notes adequare. The Exer-
cises in Writing Latin appended are a very valuable feature.''

Lita V. hortu, Woman's Collega, Baltimore.

“A heautiiul book—a credit to the publishers. The type and paper are so
clear, and the illustrations not only interesting but unusual, so that the book
produces at first sight a desire to know it better. 'l'he notes, word-groups, and
vixereises Ι think both simple and valuable.''

Everett W. Sawyer, Associate Professor of Latin, Acadio College, Wolsoille,
N. S.

¹¹1 have had the pleasure oi examining the initial volume os Macmillan's
Latin Series, Cornelius Nepos, Tkoenty Lives,by Mr. Barss. The book isa
model of what a schoolbook may be made by the intelligent coiiperation ol
publishcr and editor. Usetutness, accurate scholarship, and attractiveness
mark the book. lt satisfies alike the book lover, the scholar, and the teacher.
tt the succeeding volumes oi the series reach the same degree ol excellence as
that attained by Mr. Bnrss's Nepos, the series ought to have a wide use in pre-
paratory schools.''
