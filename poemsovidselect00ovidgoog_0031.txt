it falls after a short syllable, it is called Weala or Femi-
nine or Tracheia Caesura. We may have a caesura
whenever a word ends within a loot, but the caesura
which most commonly coincides with a rhetorical pause
is the semiquinaria or penthemimeral, the strong caesura
in the third foot :-

cum subito iuve2nis..pedi1bus tellina repulsi.

Next in importance is the semiseptenaria or hephtlae-
mimeral, the strong caesura in the fourth foot, which
is often accompanied by the semiteraaria or trihemim-
eral, the strong caesura ol the second foot : —

non galeae.. non. ensis arant ; ιι sine ι militis ι ish.

If the semitemaria fails‚a weak caesura of the second
foot occurs as the secondary caesura. Sometimes a
weak caesura ol the third foot is found.

A Debereses occurs when a word and a foot end
together:- ’

cessantem vidit, non.flesperus;oilla' duabus.

Here diaeresis occurs aiter Hesperus. Diaeresis after
the third foot, especially if thisbe a spondee, is most
carefully avoided.

Elision is the loss or slurring in pronunciation of a

Eetlalipsis is the loss or slurring in pronunciation of
a final m with a preceding short vowel before a word
