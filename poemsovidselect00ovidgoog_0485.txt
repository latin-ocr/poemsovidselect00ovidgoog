MACMILLAN'S LA TIN SERIES

THEPLANOFTHESERIFS

HE different volumes of this Series have been
prepared by practical teachers who have had
actual experience in teaching Latin in second-
ary schools. Most of the text-books in Latin

now in use were made by instructors in colleges and
universities and it is but natural that those who are
out of touch with secundary education should not in-
frequently rail to produce good schoolbooks The
books of “Macmillan's Latin Series’' are intended
primarily for school use, and have the pupil rather
than the teacher in view. They are not over-edited‚
and are not planned to win philological laurels for
the editors.

To lurnish material for so-called reading at sight, a
portion of the text of each author hasbeen printed
with only such brief notes as are absolutely necessary
to the understanding of the text. These notes are given
on the same page with the text. This ¹material can be
used also lor the rapid reading now generally recognized
as a valuable substitute for sight-reading.

The typography and manufacture of the books have
been no less a care than their contents The type is
large and clear, generously spaced and leaded; the
paper of a dull tint restful to the eyes; the binding
firm, but such as to allow the book to open flat. MapS,
plans, and illustrations are numerous and are chosen
not for ornament, but for real illustration.
