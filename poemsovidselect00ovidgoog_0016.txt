PREFACE ix

The text is that of Riese, with a lew changes
necessary to adapt certain passages to school use
and an almost complete change in punctuation and
capitalization. Constant use has been made ol the
standard German editions with notes and of the
American editions ol Kelsey‚ and Allen and Green-
ough. The Wo'rterbuclr of Siebelis has also been
very helplul. Lewis’ Elementary Latin Dz'ctionary
is the basis lor the marking of the quantity of vowels,
and has also been of considerable help in the prepa-
ration ol the vocabulary. Ι desire especially to
acknowledge the kindness ol Mr. Albertus T. Dud-
ley ol Noble and Greenough's School, Boston, who
has selected the illustrations; ol Mr. Thomas J. Kier- ¹
nan ol the Harvard College Library, and Miss J. Reid
and Mr.J. R. McDonald of The Macmillan Company‚
who have also assisted in this work; also of Mr.
Barss sor permission to use two cuts from his Nepos,
In conclusion, Ι take pleasure in cordially acknowl-
edging my deepest obligations to the editor-in-chief of
this series, Mr. John C. Kirtland, Jr„ who has been
untiring in his efforts to make the book consistent
and accurate, and has rendered much assistance by
his many valuable suggestions,
