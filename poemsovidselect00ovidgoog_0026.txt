LIFE AND WRITINGS OF OVID 3

recall the exile. He was, therefore, compellcd to spend
the rest of his life at Tomi, where he died in 17 or
18 no.

Ovid is a charming and graceful poet, full of keen
wit, and possessing preeminently the ability to tell a good
story, but superficial and frivolous. He rarely bores his
readcr‚ though he is sometimes wordy and diffuse; his
poetry charms, but does not stir deepIy, for Ovid was
lacking in those characteristics that produce a deep
impression upon men. His smooth and fluent verse,
however, together with his power of entertaining‚ have
made him a favorite poet for many generations.

The extant works of Ovid are as follows : -

Amores (Leues), in three books consisting of forty-

nine elegies‚ which sketch the amatory side of the poet’s
life.

Heroides (Heroines), twentyone love-letters repre-
sented as written by heroines to their absent lovers or
husbands; several of these are now generally supposed
to have been written by some imitator of Ovid.

'De Medicamine Faciez' (The Use of coronatio), of
which onlya fragment of one hundred lines has reached
us, addressed to women, and giving advice on the art of
the toilet.

Ars Amatoria (The Art os Leve), in three books (the
first two books addressed to men, and the third to
women), treating of the successful ways of winning love,
and of retaining it when once won.

Remedia Amoris (Cures os Love), a sort of appendix
