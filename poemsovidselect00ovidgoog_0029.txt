ΙΙ. SCANSION

Ancient versification was a matter of quantity. To
be able to read Latin poetry with pleasure one must
pronounce correctly, and to pronounce correctly one
must know and carefully observe the quantities of the
syllables Any one who can pronounce Latin fairly
well and can read with intelligence Longfellow’s
Evangeliae will have little trouble in mastering Ovid’s
verse.

The poems of Ovid are written in dactylic meters.
The hexameter (ale. a verse of six measures or feet), the
meter of Homer and Vergil, is used in the Meta-
morphoses and Hala'euta'aa,· in his other works the
hexameter alternates with the socalled pentameter (ie.
averse of five measures or feet), forming the Elegiae
Da‘sticlt.

The basis of all dactylic meters is the dactyl, com-
posed of one long and two short syllables (expressed
-υ υ). Now, by quantity we mean the time it takes
to pronounce a syllable. The unit of measurement is
the short syllable (marked υ); the long syllable
(marked —) takes just twice as long in pronunciation
as the short. Since, therefore, the long syllable is twice
as long as the short, it is obvious that two short syllables
equal one long; and hence we may expect to find a
spondae, composed of two long syllables (expressed
--), used instead of the dactyl. So instead of
a foot of three syllables, one long and two short, we
often have a foot of two long syllables. The fifth
