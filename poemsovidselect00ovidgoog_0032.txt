scnwsrow 9

Here um in peregrlnum is slurred‚ if pronounced at all,
before ut.

By hiatus is meant the failure of elision when a final
vowel is kept in pronunciation before a word beginning
with another vowel or with lt. This is generally
avoided by Ovid‚ who, as a rule, allows hiatus only
when the final long vowel or diphthongis shortened.
This is called semi-hiatus:—

verba locusnnicytoque “Va116‚..vale‚”.inquit etrllcho.

The final syllable of the second vale is not elided‚ but
ἒ becomes ἔ.

Synaplzeia is the elision of' a final syllable in one
verse before the initial vowel of the following verse : —

perque vinis vinliss⁰ homi,num..simu;licra fe.rimm.qu⁸'
in silioem ex ipsisnvici conversa Medici.

The first verse has an extra syllable, que, which is elided
before in of the following verse. The verse which has

. the extra syllable is called a hypermeter.

Syniaesis is the pronunciation of two separate vowels
as one syllable: afflue, deinde (both pronounced as dis-
syllables); omnya for omnia.

Each foot may be divided into thesis (the first long
syllable) and arsis (the second long syllable of a spondee
or the two short syllables of a dactyl). The promi-
nence of the thesis of a foot is known as ictus. Ictus
is commonly treated as a rhythmical arcent, and so
marked:-

airea.prr'ma sad· {otnanti‘s quaemindicemfillo.
